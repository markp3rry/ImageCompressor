{"name":"Imagecompressor","tagline":"A simple Windows .exe that compresses .JPG files","body":"ImageCompressor\r\n===============\r\n\r\nA simple Windows .exe that compresses .JPG files.\r\n\r\nWritten to solve a problem that a friend of mine was having at work. He works for the NHS and his team receives high resolution images that need to be uploaded to a case management system. The images are often 5MB+ in size and they need to be less than 1.5MB to get uploaded. This results in a messy process where team members are spending time manually reducing image size in Paint. This .exe will do the work for them much, much quicker.\r\n\r\n**How it works**\r\n\r\nCompile the code. Create two folders on your computer; c:\\jpeg_in and c:\\jpeg_out (these are hardcoded). Put the image(s) you want to resize into the in folder and run the .exe (under admin mode otherwise you will get permissions errors). Resized images will be get dropped into the out folder (which is emptied of all content first).\r\n\r\nI have released this code under an [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
